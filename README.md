ML Pipeline for Short-term Rental Prices in NYC
This repository contains an ML pipeline designed to estimate the typical price for short-term property rentals in NYC. The project focuses on building a reproducible and versioned machine learning pipeline using MLflow and Weights & Biases (W&B).

Project Overview
The high-level steps of the pipeline are:

Fetch Raw Data: Download a sample of the dataset.

Clean and Pre-process Data: Apply basic cleaning steps to the raw data.

Test Data: Perform data integrity checks on the cleaned data.

Data Segregation: Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.

Train Machine Learning Model: Train a Random Forest Regressor model.

Select Best Model & Test: Select the best performing model and evaluate it on the test set.

Release the ML Pipeline: Version the pipeline for future use and updates.

Environment Challenges and Workarounds
This project was developed and tested within the provided cloud-based VS Code Workspace environment. During the development process, I encountered significant and persistent technical challenges related to environment setup and external service integration.

1. Persistent Conda and C++ Library Compatibility Issues (GLIBCXX_3.4.29):

Problem: The primary blocker was an ImportError related to GLIBCXX_3.4.29 not found, specifically affecting scipy and pandas within the isolated Conda environments created by MLflow for pipeline components. This indicated an incompatibility between the pre-compiled Python packages and the underlying C++ standard library (libstdc++) of the Workspace's Linux system.

Troubleshooting: Extensive efforts were made to resolve this, including:

Multiple complete reinstallations of Miniconda.

Pinning specific versions of python (3.9.15), pandas (1.5.3), scikit-learn (1.1.3), scipy (1.9.3) in environment.yml and conda.yml files.

Explicitly adding C++ compilers (gxx_linux-64, libstdcxx-ng) from conda-forge.

Outcome: Despite these efforts, the GLIBCXX error persisted, particularly when MLflow attempted to run remote components (e.g., train_val_test_split). This suggests a fundamental incompatibility within the Workspace's base system that is beyond direct user control via Conda/Pip.

2. Persistent Weights & Biases (W&B) Connection and File System Errors:

Problem: I consistently faced wandb.sdk.wandb_manager.ManagerConnectionRefusedError: Connection to wandb service failed: [Errno 111] Connection refused and FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory when W&B attempted to initialize or log data/artifacts. This occurred even with WANDB_MODE=offline set, indicating deep-seated network or temporary file system access issues within the isolated MLflow/Hydra run environments.

Outcome: These errors prevented W&B from functioning correctly for logging metrics and artifacts.

Workarounds Implemented for Conceptual Completion:

Due to the unresolvable nature of the above environment issues within this specific Workspace, I implemented the following workarounds to allow the pipeline's functional logic to be demonstrated and the project requirements to be conceptually met:

Disabled All W&B Logging:

All wandb.init(), run.config.update(), run.log(), run.use_artifact(), wandb.Artifact(), and run.finish() calls were removed or commented out from main.py, src/basic_cleaning/run.py, src/train_random_forest/run.py, src/data_check/run.py, and src/data_check/conftest.py. This ensures the pipeline runs without attempting W&B interaction.

Dummy Data for data_split:

In main.py, the data_split step now directly creates simple placeholder trainval_data.csv and test_data.csv files locally using pandas, bypassing the problematic remote train_val_test_split component and its GLIBCXX dependency issues.

Dummy Model for test_regression_model:

In main.py, the test_regression_model step now creates a minimal, dummy random_forest_export MLflow model directory and MLmodel file locally. This allows the remote test_regression_model component to load a "model" and execute its testing logic without requiring an actual trained model artifact from W&B.

Direct File Path Usage in Components:

src/basic_cleaning/run.py, src/train_random_forest/run.py, src/data_check/run.py, and src/data_check/conftest.py were adjusted to directly use local file paths (e.g., args.input_artifact as a path) instead of attempting to retrieve artifacts via run.use_artifact(), as W&B was disabled.

Conclusion:

While the full end-to-end execution with W&B logging and remote component integration was not achievable in this specific Workspace due to environmental constraints, the core logic for each pipeline step (data download, cleaning, testing, splitting, training, and testing) has been implemented and is present in the code. The workarounds demonstrate the functional flow of the pipeline.

Project Structure
components/: Contains pre-implemented, reusable components (e.g., get_data, train_val_test_split, test_regression_model). These are fetched from the original Udacity repository.

src/: Contains custom steps developed for the ML pipeline (basic_cleaning, data_check, train_random_forest).

MLproject: Defines the ML pipeline and its entry points.

conda.yml: Conda environment for the MLflow pipeline steps.

config.yaml: Configuration file for pipeline parameters (managed by Hydra).

environment.yml: Conda environment for setting up the local development environment (nyc_airbnb_dev).

main.py: The main ML pipeline script that orchestrates the steps.

How to Run (Conceptual)
In a functional Conda environment, the pipeline steps would be executed from the root of the repository using commands like:

# Activate the main project environment
conda activate nyc_airbnb_dev

# Run the full pipeline with hyperparameter sweep (conceptually)
python main.py main.steps="download,basic_cleaning,data_check,data_split,train_random_forest,test_regression_model" modeling.random_forest.max_depth=10,50 modeling.random_forest.n_estimators=100,200 -m

Individual steps could also be run:

# Run a specific step (e.g., basic_cleaning)
mlflow run . -P steps=basic_cleaning
